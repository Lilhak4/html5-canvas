# HTML5 Canvas
## 9 out of 30
This repository is part of an ongoing program created by Wes Bos to improve on various skills pertaining to javascript. Nice introduction to canvas for me. I learned about some different canvas functions and hsl color schema. Canvas could be something I would work with for fun in the future.
